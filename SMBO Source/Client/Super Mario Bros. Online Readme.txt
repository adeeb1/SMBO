****************************
* 5. Ranged Weapons & Ammo *
****************************

Super Mario Bros. Online has many types of weapons, including ranged weapons. These weapons can either have
unlimited ammo or limited ammo. If a weapon has unlimited ammo, then you can continue using it as a weapon
as long as you like. However, a weapon with limited ammo has limited uses before it needs to be refilled
with ammo. Different ranged weapons use different types of ammo, and each weapon can only be refilled with
its respective ammo type. In order to refill a ranged weapon that has some or no ammo remaining, simply
double-click on the respective ammo in your inventory, and your weapon will be refilled with ammo.

**********************
* 6. Special Attacks *
**********************

Special attacks are attacks that can do a variety of things, such as heal you, harm others, 
and increase various stats temporarily. However, you cannot use these for as long as you like
because they require FP to perform. You learn Special Attacks on level up, and each character 
has different Special Attacks.

*********************
* 7. Save Points    *
*********************

Save Points, or respawn points, are the places you will return to after you die.
To set your Save Point, jump under a Save Block (a block with an "S" on it).

**************
* 8. Jumping *
**************

Super Mario Bros. Online features the ability to jump. Press Delete to jump up or
down various platforms and hit blocks. You can also jump over other players.
Please note that you cannot jump on every platform.

*********************
* 9. Socializing    *
*********************

Socializing is an important aspect of every online game. To talk with other players,type a 
message in the textbox above the chatbox and press Enter to send the message to everyone else 
on the map. If you wish to broadcast a message to every player online, type ' before your message 
and press Enter. For example, typing 'hi would send the word "hi" to every player online. This 
feature may be removed as the game grows because there will be too many players broadcasting their 
messages, and it will be extremely difficult to figure out who's talking to who.

You can also send someone a Private Message. To send a Private Message, open up the "Online" tab
and click on "Private Message." Type in the name of the player you wish to send the message to and then
type the message you wish to send to the player. After that, just click "Send Message" and you're done! 

If you want to trade with a player, stand at most 3 spaces away from the player and type /trade. If the
player accepts, you will enter a trade. Select the items that you want to offer and click on "Accept Trade"
when you feel that the trade is fair. Trading is explained in further detail in the Trading section.

*************
* 10. Stats *
*************

If you click on the "Character" tab, you will see a lot of stats, and most likely, will wonder what each one does.
Here's the breakdown:

HP: Heart Points, or life. When this reaches 0, you will die and return to your respawn point. HP is the
upper-most icon on the top-left of the game screen.
FP: Flower Points. Flower Points are necessary to perform Special Attacks, which can do special effects,
including healing your HP. FP is under the HP icon on the top-left of the game screen.

Attack: How much damage you can inflict upon enemies or other players.
Defense: How much damage you can resist from enemies or other players.
Speed: How long you can run, whether or not you will go first in a turn-based battle, and the chance at blocking
an enemy attack.
Stache: The chance of landing Criticals, which deal 1.5x more damage than normal attacks.The higher your Stache, 
the more discounts you will receive at shops. It also allows you to sell items for a higher price at shops.

You can also find information about these stats by hovering your mouse over their names on the "Character" tab.

When you level up by killing enough enemies, you will get to choose which stat you want to increase. You only 
get to choose once per level, so choose wisely!

****************
* 11. Commands *
****************

/help: Lists commands that can be used.
/trade: Trades with another player. Use this when you're at most 3 spaces away from another player, otherwise
it won't work.
/inv: Opens up your inventory. You can also click on the "Inventory" tab to open up your inventory.
/party: Invites others to a party. In a party, players can fight together and share experience points 
received from enemies.
/join: Joins a party.
/leave: Leaves a party.

***************
* 12. Trading *
***************

Like many other online games, Super Mario Bros. Online has a trade feature between players. To trade, type "/trade"
in the chatbox. After that, hit the spacebar once and type the exact name of the player you want to trade with. For
example, if Kimimaru wanted to trade with hydrakiller4000, Kimimaru would type  "/trade hydrakiller4000." Note that
you must be on the same map and at most 3 spaces away from the other player to trade. Once a trade request is
successfully sent, a trade offer will appear on the requested player's screen, and he or she will be prompted to
either accept or decline the offer. Once you and your trade partner are in a trade, you will be able to add and
remove items from your trade offer. Once you accept the trade, your trade partner will also need to accept the trade
in order for both of you to successfully exchange items. To reject your approval of the trade but not cancel the 
trade itself, simply add or remove an item.

Remember to always double check your trades before you accept them so you don't get ripped off. The Super Mario
Bros. Online staff isn't responsible for anything that occurs in a trade. The Super Mario Bros. Online staff
reserves the right to take any unreleased or restricted items from any player.

*************
* 13. Cards *
*************

Cards are items in Super Mario Bros. Online that can be considered collectibles. Cards are dropped by enemies, and
almost every NPC has its own card. In the Mushroom Kingdom Sewers, there is a Card Shop that sells cards to players, 
some of which are unobtainable any other way. There is also a spot players can go to if they want to check their 
card collection. 

The card collection will list the cards you currently have as well as empty card slots. The empty card slots indicate 
cards the player is missing. So, if there are 5 empty card slots, then the player is missing 5 cards. When you select
a card you have in your collection, information regarding the enemy will display. The enemy's HP, Attack, Defense, and
Experience earned when defeated, along with a small description of the enemy, will be displayed.

To add a card to your collection, double-click on it when you have it in your inventory, and you will receive a
message that the card has been added to your collection. If you double-click on a card and this message does not
pop up, then you have already added the card to your collection. Cards are pretty rare and therefore are pretty
expensive, so do not just throw away a card when you've added it to your collection; try to sell it at a local
shop or to other players. Once you've added the card to your collection, you no longer need to have it in your
inventory or bank to check out any of its information on the collection screen.


**************************
* 14. Turn-based Battles *
**************************

The ability to have turn-based battles in Super Mario Bros. Online has been introduced in the beta release of the game.
Turn-based battles are battles in which players and NPCs alternate their moves. For example, a player gets into a
battle and then is given an opportunity to make a move. The player chooses to attack the enemy. After that, the NPC
now has the opportunity to make a move, and the player must wait for the NPC to finish its move before he/she can
make another move.

When a player is in a turn-based battle, he/she gets moved to a different location and faces the NPC. When it is the
player's turn, he/she will be able to see his/her battle options and alternate between them by using the left and 
right arrow keys. Once the player is sure of his/her next course of action, he/she can press CTRL to execute that
action and end his/her turn.

While in a turn-based battle, a player is invisible to other players, and no other player can interact with that player
unless the players send messages to each other. However, the player in the battle is able to see other players, but
he/she is unable to move or interact with other players himself/herself.

Turn-based battles are also optional. To enable turn-based battles, click on the "Settings" tab and check the box
labeled "Turn-based Battles." Uncheck or keep this box unchecked if you want to use the traditional action battle
system.
